## Review ##
<p>
  Wow, this was one quite hard CTF, overall for my skill level was also a little bit frustrating but the enthusiasm and willingness to solve more was the thing that keep me moving and to do research and not give up even when you don't know what to do
  Now looking back at some writeups from challenges that I attempted, but did not solve is crazy that for some I was on the path that would lead me to solve it, but some just overthinking.
  Anyway hopefully with more experience and more training I'll be able to get more solutions on next CTFs
